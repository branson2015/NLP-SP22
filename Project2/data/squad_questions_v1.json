Why I chose medicine I hardly know.\nPossibly the career of a surgeon attracted the adventurous element in\nme. Perhaps, coming of a family of doctors, I merely followed the line\nof least resistance. It may be, indirectly but inevitably, that I might\nbe on the yacht Ella on that terrible night of August 12, more than a\nyear ago.\n\nI got through somehow. I played quarterback on the football team, and\nmade some money coaching. In summer I did whatever came to hand, from\nchartering a sail-boat at a summer resort and taking passengers, at so\nmuch a head, to checking up cucumbers in Indiana for a Western pickle\nhouse.\n\nI was practically alone. Commencement left me with a diploma, a new\ndress-suit, an out-of-date medical library, a box of surgical\ninstruments of the same date as the books, and an incipient case of\ntyphoid fever.\n\nI was twenty-four, six feet tall, and forty inches around the chest.\nAlso, I had lived clean, and worked and played hard. I got over the\nfever finally, pretty much all bone and appetite; but—alive. Thanks to\nthe college, my hospital care had cost nothing. It was a good thing: I\nhad just seven dollars in the world.\n\nThe yacht Ella lay in the river not far from my hospital windows. She\nwas not a yacht when I first saw her, nor at any time, technically,\nunless I use the word in the broad sense of a pleasure-boat. She was a\ntwo-master, and, when I saw her first, as dirty and disreputable as are\nmost coasting-vessels. \n",

I lowered the revolver and gasped: “Call the\ncaptain! Vail’s been murdered!\n\n“Good God!” he said. “Who did it?” He had taken the wheel again, and\nwas bringing the ship back to her course.

He was a benevolent little man, highly religious, and something\nof a philosopher. And because I could understand German, and even essay\nit in a limited way, he was fond of me.\n\n“Setz du dich,” he said, and moved over so that I could sit on the\ngrating on which he stood. “The sky is fine to-night. Wunderschon!”\n\n“It always looks good to me,” I observed, filling my pipe and passing\nmy tobacco-bag to him. “I may have my doubts now and then on land,\nCharlie; but here, between the sky and the sea, I’m a believer, right\nenough.”\n\n“‘In the beginning He created the heaven and the earth,’” said Charlie\nreverently.\n\nWe were silent for a time. The ship rolled easily; now and then she\ndipped her bowsprit with a soft swish of spray; a school of dolphins\nplayed astern, and the last of the land birds that had followed us out\nflew in circles around the masts.\n\n“Sometimes,” said Charlie Jones, “I think the Good Man should have left\nit the way it was after the flood—just sky and water. What’s the land,\nanyhow? Noise and confusion, wickedness and crime, robbing the widow\nand the orphan, eat or be et.”\n\n“Well,” I argued, “the sea’s that way. What are those fish out there\nflying for, but to get out of the way of bigger fish?”\n\nCharlie Jones surveyed me over his pipe.\n",

Always a madman, the homicidal element of his\ndisease was recurrent and of a curious nature.\n\nHe thought himself a priest of heaven, appointed to make ghastly\nsacrifices at certain signals from on high. The signals I am not sure\nof; he turned taciturn after his capture and would not talk. I am\ninclined to think that a shooting star, perhaps in a particular quarter\nof the heavens, was his signal. This is distinctly possible, and is\nmade probable by the stars which he had painted with tar on his\nsacrificial robe.\n\nThe story of the early morning of August 12 will never be fully known;\nbut much of it, in view of our knowledge, we were able to reconstruct.\nThus—Jones ate his supper that night, a mild and well-disposed\nindividual. During the afternoon before, he had read prayers for the\nsoul of Schwartz, in whose departure he may or may not have had a part.\nI am inclined to think not, Jones construing his mission as being one\nto remove the wicked and the oppressor, and Schwartz hardly coming\nunder either classification.\n\nHe was at the wheel from midnight until four in the morning on the\nnight of the murders. At certain hours we believe that he went forward\nto the forecastle-head, and performed, clad in his priestly robe, such\ndevotions as his disordered mind dictated. It is my idea that he\nlooked, at these times, for a heavenly signal, either a meteor or some\nstrange appearance of the heavens. It was known that he was a poor\nsleeper, and spent much time at night wandering around.\n",
