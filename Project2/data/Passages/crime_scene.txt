His door was open an inch or so. I went in and felt my way to his bunk.
I could hear him breathing, a stertorous respiration like that of
sleep, and yet unlike. The moment I touched him, the sound ceased, and
did not commence again. I struck a match and bent over him.

He had been almost cut to pieces with an axe.




The match burnt out, and I dropped it. I remember mechanically
extinguishing the glowing end with my heel, and then straightening to
such a sense of horror as I have never felt before or since. I groped
for the door; I wanted air, space, the freedom from lurking death of
the open deck.

I had been sleeping with my revolver beside me on the pantry floor.
Somehow or other I got back there and found it. I made an attempt to
find the switch for the cabin lights, and, failing, revolver in hand, I
ran into the chart-room and up the after companionway. Charlie Jones
was at the wheel, and by the light of a lantern I saw that he was
bending to the right, peering in at the chartroom window. He turned
when he heard me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked. “I heard a yell a minute ago. Turner on the
rampage?” He saw my revolver then, and, letting go the wheel, threw up
both his hands. “Turn that gun away, you fool!”

I could hardly speak. I lowered the revolver and gasped: “Call the
captain! Vail’s been murdered!

“Good God!” he said. “Who did it?” He had taken the wheel again, and
was bringing the ship back to her course. I was turning sick and dizzy,
and I clutched at the railing of the companionway.

“I don’t know. Where’s the captain?”
