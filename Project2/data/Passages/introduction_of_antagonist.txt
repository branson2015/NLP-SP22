Turner had gone below, grimly good-humored, to dress for dinner; and I
went aft to chat, as I often did, with the steersman. On this occasion
it happened to be Charlie Jones. Jones was not his name, so far as I
know. It was some inordinately long and different German inheritance,
and so, with the facility of the average crew, he had been called
Jones. He was a benevolent little man, highly religious, and something
of a philosopher. And because I could understand German, and even essay
it in a limited way, he was fond of me.

“Setz du dich,” he said, and moved over so that I could sit on the
grating on which he stood. “The sky is fine to-night. Wunderschon!”

“It always looks good to me,” I observed, filling my pipe and passing
my tobacco-bag to him. “I may have my doubts now and then on land,
Charlie; but here, between the sky and the sea, I’m a believer, right
enough.”

“‘In the beginning He created the heaven and the earth,’” said Charlie
reverently.

We were silent for a time. The ship rolled easily; now and then she
dipped her bowsprit with a soft swish of spray; a school of dolphins
played astern, and the last of the land birds that had followed us out
flew in circles around the masts.

“Sometimes,” said Charlie Jones, “I think the Good Man should have left
it the way it was after the flood—just sky and water. What’s the land,
anyhow? Noise and confusion, wickedness and crime, robbing the widow
and the orphan, eat or be et.”

“Well,” I argued, “the sea’s that way. What are those fish out there
flying for, but to get out of the way of bigger fish?”

Charlie Jones surveyed me over his pipe.
